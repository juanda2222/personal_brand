I like to use 10-30% of the time used to build a feature to create the tests. If is taking to long, then I will compromise and just test the most relevant functionality of the feature. If it is a black and white situation, the question is about how much money would the company  loose if the \"critical section of the code\" breakes. After that it's just math.\n\nQ: What can you tell me about your expirience as a Software Engineer in R & S Investments during 2019?\nA: Use Python, Bigquery and no SQL data to reduce storage costs by 70% migrating to other technologies.\n\nQ: The site is slow and you’ve been tasked with improving the speed of a particular page.
